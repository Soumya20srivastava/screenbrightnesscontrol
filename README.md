The code imports necessary libraries such as mediapipe for hand landmark detection, numpy for numerical calculations, screen_brightness_control for adjusting screen brightness, cv2 for capturing and processing video frames, and math.hypot for calculating the Euclidean distance between two points.
It sets up the video capture from the default webcam.
The MediaPipe Hands model for hand landmark detection is initialized.
An infinite loop is started to continuously process video frames from the webcam.
Each iteration reads a frame from the video capture.
The color space of the frame is converted from BGR to RGB (MediaPipe requires RGB input).
The RGB frame is processed using the MediaPipe Hands model to detect hand landmarks.
It iterates through each detected hand landmark:
Extracts the coordinates of each landmark and normalizes them to the frame dimensions.
Draws the landmarks and hand connections on the frame.
If hand landmarks are detected:
It extracts the coordinates of specific landmarks (4 and 8), typically the tip of the thumb and the tip of the index finger.
Draws circles at these landmark points and a line between them on the frame.
The code calculates the Euclidean distance (length) between the two specific landmarks.
It adjusts the brightness based on the calculated length:
Uses np.interp to map the length to a brightness value between 0 and 100.
Sets the screen brightness using sbc.set_brightness.
The annotated frame with hand landmarks and brightness-adjusted line is displayed.
It checks for the 'q' key press to exit the loop.
